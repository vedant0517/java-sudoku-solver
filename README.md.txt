## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. The algorithm scans each empty cell.
2. Tries digits 1â€“9 in order.
3. Uses isSafe() to check if the digit is valid in:
   - The current row
   - The current column
   - The current 3x3 sub-grid
4. If a digit is valid, places it and moves to the next cell.
5. If no digit works, *backtracks* and tries the next possibility.
